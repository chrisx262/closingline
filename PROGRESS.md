# PROGRESS.md — session state (Claude Code: keep this current)

## Task board (specs in HANDOFF.md)

- [x] 1. Deploy to Railway/Fly — DONE 2026-07-12: live at
       https://closingline-production.up.railway.app (Railway, Postgres,
       ADMIN_KEY/MIN_PICKS/ODDS_API_KEY env vars, smoke-tested: /, /docs,
       /leaderboard, /data/games=272, register + admin auth verified)
- [ ] 2. Wire owner's real model in via examples/agent_stub.py
- [ ] 3. Friend onboarding verified against the deployed URL
- [x] 4. Odds snapshot cron — DONE 2026-07-13: snapshot_odds() finished
       (32-team map, top-3-book consensus, 36h kickoff matching; live-
       verified: 75/75 events captured). scheduler.py runs the full cadence
       incl. Sun 11:35 post-inactives + Tue 09:00 weekly_update, in-process
       (RUN_SCHEDULER=1), DST-safe, off-season auto-skip. 15 new checks.
- [ ] 4b. /data/injuries feed with as_of
- [ ] 5. Explorer line-movement charts (needs multi-snapshot data)
- [ ] 6. Elo v2: QB-out adjustment + EPA ratings (train ≤2024, blind 2025)
- [ ] 7. Hardening: rate limiting, MIN_PICKS=30, email unsubscribe/delete,
       real accounts to replace browser-stored keys
- [ ] 8. Monetization activation — AFTER a live paper season is underway
- [ ] 9. Futures picks + season-end settlement + explorer futures board

(honest -24% blind test) · report cards incl. timing buckets · hedge
support · data explorer + real situational trends · human picks page
(one-step signup) · email capture + digest generator · affiliate +
sponsor slots with click tracking · API keys hashed · UTC timezone fix ·
29-check regression suite

## Decisions log

- (Claude Code: append decisions here, dated, one line each)
- 2026-07-12: season preload moved from Docker build to boot.py runtime
  (build-time seeding landed in throwaway sqlite, never in Postgres).
- 2026-07-12: boot seeds per-season [2025, 2026] — odds matching needs the
  coming season's schedule; merge-by-id makes reseeding safe.
- 2026-07-13: cron = in-process scheduler thread (RUN_SCHEDULER=1) instead
  of Railway cron services — zero dashboard config, DST-safe via zoneinfo,
  slot logic unit-tested. Revisit if the service ever runs >1 replica.
- 2026-07-13: Odds API cost verified live: 3 credits/snapshot (markets x
  regions), cadence ~66/month vs 500 free. weekly_update runs Tue 09:00 ET
  per README (cadence doc's Mon 09:00 slot superseded).
